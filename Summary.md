#Movie Correlation

In this project, I worked with a movie dataset using Python. I started by cleaning the data and then sorted it to identify the highest grossing movie of all time. 
To gain more insights into the data, I used the Pearson correlation coefficient to examine relationships between different pairs of columns.

To make the results of my analysis more easily accessible, I created two different types of visualizations: a heatmap and a scatterplot. 
The heatmap helped me to easily identify correlations between pairs of columns by representing them as colors. 
The scatterplot allowed me to graphically represent the relationship between two variables.

Overall, my project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Python. 
I've successfully created informative visuals that help others to understand the relationships between different variables in the movie dataset.
