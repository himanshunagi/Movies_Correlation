# Movie's Correlation

In this project, I utilized Python to analyze a movie dataset and investigate the factors influencing gross revenue. I performed data cleaning and sorting to identify the highest-grossing movie of all time. To gain deeper insights, I employed the Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relationships between various variables.

To present the findings effectively, I created visualizations including a heatmap and scatterplot. The heatmap visually represents correlations between different variables using color gradients, while the scatterplot illustrates the relationship between two variables graphically.

This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python. The informative visuals generated provide a comprehensive understanding of the correlations among different variables in the movie dataset."
